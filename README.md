## 📌 Description

This is a fully functional **Snake Game** built using **C++** and **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. The game presents:

- Classic snake mechanics
- Speed increase as the snake eats more food
- Sound effects for food consumption
- Visual gameplay using a 2D graphics window

The project was built as part of the **CODTECH Internship** and demonstrates basic game logic, real-time rendering, and multimedia integration.
